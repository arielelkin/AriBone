Real-time modulations of jaw harp sounds with an iPhone! My hack for Music Hack Day Stockholm 2013.

Uses [ObjectAL](http://kstenerud.github.com/ObjectAL-for-iPhone/) and the [Synthesis Toolkit in C++](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/).

To be continued. 

##Usage
1. tape a jaw harp to the side of your phone, near its microphone
1. Hold the phone upside down (in portait), plug headphones in.
1. Run the app.
1. Tilting the phone forwards or backwards modulates the audio.
1. Playing the harp while tilting it will trigger a sample!
1. Playing the harp while pressing the button will modulate a sample.
